        You are receiving this survey in an attempt to help facilitate 2017 server/storage migrations. You are identified in our systems to be the owner of a server that:        
        <ol class="surveyol">
          <li>The server currently resides on an array that will be decommissioned prior to the end of 2017.</li>
          <li>The server is currently running on hardware that is beyond End of Service Life (EOSL).</li>
          <li>The server has an Operating System (OS) that is also Unsupported moving forward, in this case the OS is Windows 2008 (W2K8)</li>
        </ol> 
        We will help facilitate by submitting for a new server build of equal or greater specs to the existing server.<br><br>
        
        In order to facilitate the migration we need you to agree to the following tasks.<br>
